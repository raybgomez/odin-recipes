    <h2>Nope, it's not eggnog!</h2>
    <p>
      In Puerto Rico, it wouldn't be the holidays without sipping a glass of
      coquito. This traditional drink is the staple of Christmas in Puerto Rico.
      Some may describe it as eggnog but in fact, their are no eggs used to make
      coquito. The name means "small coconut" and you'll come to know why.
